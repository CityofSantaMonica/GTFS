# Routes and Stops

- The stops file is derived from stops.txt in the GTFS data.
- The routes file is derived from a different system. However, it has been attached to a copy of routes.txt in the GTFS data.
- There are some inaccuracies in the route vectors (they do not follow street center lines correctly).
